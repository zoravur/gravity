# Gravity.js

This is a 2D Newtonian gravity simulator written with Javascript, inspired by [nowykurier.com](http://www.nowykurier.com/toys/gravity/gravity.html). You can see a live demo [here](https://zoravur.github.io/gravity/dist).

<!--
To add a particle, click at the desired location and drag to specify the velocity. The mass can be set in the input below the canvas.

To shift the view, hold Shift and drag with the mouse. Enjoy.

> _If there's one thing you take away from this, never forget: Always use a symplectic integrator when simulating hamiltonian systems._
